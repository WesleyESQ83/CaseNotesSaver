Case Entry Application

Overview

The Case Entry Application is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) tool designed to streamline the process of filling out structured case reports. It allows users to input key details into predefined fields, validates the inputs, and copies the formatted data to the clipboard for easy sharing.

Features

Simple GUI: Built with the Tkinter library for a user-friendly interface.

Predefined Fields: Includes fields such as "Summary and problem statement," "Testing performed," "KBs used," "Conclusion," and "Action plan/Next steps."

Input Validation: Ensures all fields are filled before submission.

Clipboard Integration: Automatically copies the formatted case details to the clipboard.

Error Handling: Displays warnings if any fields are left empty.

Python 3.x

The tkinter library (pre-installed with Python on most systems)
